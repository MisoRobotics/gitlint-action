## Overview

The **GitLint Action** is a GitHub Action that enforces naming conventions and formatting rules for commits, branches, and pull requests. It helps maintain consistency and professionalism across your Git repository by automatically checking various aspects of your Git workflow.

## Basic Information

- **Name**: GitLint Action
- **Purpose**: Check if naming conventions for commits, branches, and pull requests are respected
- **Icon**: Check mark (âœ“)
- **Color**: Blue
- **Runtime**: Node.js 12

## Configuration Options

### Message Length Controls

#### Commit Message Body
- **Maximum Length**: 72 characters (default)
- **Minimum Length**: No limit (-1 means disabled)
- **Blank Lines**: Can be prohibited if desired (disabled by default)

#### Commit Message Subject
- **Maximum Length**: 72 characters (default) 
- **Minimum Length**: No limit (-1 means disabled)

### Security & Authentication

#### GitHub Token
- **Required**: Yes
- **Default**: Uses the automatically provided GitHub token
- **Purpose**: Allows the action to access GitHub's API

#### Commit Security Options
- **Unknown Authors**: Can prohibit commits from authors not known to GitHub
- **Unknown Committers**: Can prohibit commits from committers not known to GitHub  
- **Unsigned Commits**: Can require all commits to have valid signatures
- **Default**: All security checks are disabled

## Regular Expression Rules (The Important Part!)

### Branch Names (`re-branch-name`)
**Pattern**: `.*`
**Translation**: Accepts any branch name - no restrictions by default.

### Email Addresses (`re-commit-author-email` & `re-commit-committer-email`)
**Pattern**: `.*`
**Translation**: Accepts any email format - no restrictions by default.

### Person Names (Authors & Committers)

#### Author Names (`re-commit-author-name`)
**Pattern**: 
```
^[A-Z][a-z]+[A-Za-z]*(-[A-Z][a-z]+[A-Za-z]*)*( ((St\.|[Vv]an|[Dd]e[lr]?|[Ll]a)|[A-Z](\.|[a-z]+[A-Za-z]*)(-[A-Z](\.|[a-z]+[A-Za-z]*))*))*( [A-Z][a-z]+[A-Za-z]*(-[A-Z][a-z]+[A-Za-z]*)*)$
```

**Translation in Plain English**:
Names must follow proper capitalization rules:
- Start with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters
- Can include hyphenated names (like "Mary-Jane")
- Handles name prefixes properly:
  - "St." (Saint)
  - "van", "Van"  
  - "de", "del", "der"
  - "la", "La"
- Allows middle names and initials
- Must end with a proper name part

**Examples that PASS**:
- "John Smith"
- "Mary-Jane Watson"
- "Jean-Claude van Damme"
- "Leonardo da Vinci"
- "St. John"
- "Maria del Carmen"

**Examples that FAIL**:
- "john smith" (not capitalized)
- "JOHN SMITH" (all caps)
- "John" (needs last name)

#### Committer Names (`re-commit-committer-name`)
**Pattern**: Same as author names, but also allows "GitHub" as a valid name.

**Translation**: Same rules as author names, plus accepts "GitHub" (for automated commits).

### Commit Messages

#### Message Structure (`re-commit-message-split`)
**Pattern**: `([^\n]*)(?:\n\n(.*))?`

**Translation**: Splits commit messages into:
- **Subject**: Everything on the first line
- **Body**: Everything after a blank line (optional)

#### Message Body (`re-commit-message-body`)
**Pattern**: `.*`
**Translation**: Accepts any content in the message body - no restrictions.

#### Message Subject (`re-commit-message-subject`)
**Pattern**:
```
^(([A-Z0-9]{2,10}-[0-9]+)(, [A-Z0-9]{2,10}-[0-9]+)*: )?\b(?!Made)(?![A-Za-z]*(ing|ung|ang|ed|id|[^s]s)\b)[A-Z][a-z]*\b [/\- ._,()A-Za-z0-9]*[)A-Za-z0-9]$
```

**Translation in Plain English**:
Commit subjects must follow these rules:

1. **Optional Ticket Reference**: 
   - Can start with project ticket numbers like "PROJ-123: " or "DEV-456, TASK-789: "
   - Ticket format: 2-10 uppercase letters/numbers, dash, then numbers

2. **Imperative Mood**: 
   - Must start with a capital letter
   - Cannot start with "Made"
   - Cannot use past tense or gerund forms (-ing, -ed, -s endings)
   - Should be a command/instruction format

3. **Content**:
   - Must have additional content after the first word
   - Can include letters, numbers, spaces, and common punctuation
   - Must end with a letter or number (not punctuation)

**Examples that PASS**:
- "Add user authentication feature"
- "PROJ-123: Fix login validation bug"
- "DEV-456, TASK-789: Update database schema"
- "Remove deprecated API endpoints"

**Examples that FAIL**:
- "Added new feature" (past tense)
- "Adding new feature" (gerund)
- "made changes" (starts with "Made", not capitalized)
- "Fix" (too short, needs more content)
- "Updates the system" (ends with 's')

### Pull Request Titles (`re-pull-request-title`)
**Pattern**:
```
^([A-Z0-9]{2,10}-[0-9]+)(, [A-Z0-9]{2,10}-[0-9]+)*: \b(?!Made)(?![A-Za-z]*(ing|ung|ang|ed|id|[^s]s)\b)[A-Z][a-z]*\b [/\- ._,()A-Za-z0-9]*[)A-Za-z0-9]$
```

**Translation**: Same rules as commit subjects, but **requires** a ticket reference at the beginning.

**Examples that PASS**:
- "PROJ-123: Implement user dashboard"
- "DEV-456, PROJ-789: Update API documentation"

**Examples that FAIL**:
- "Implement user dashboard" (missing ticket reference)
- "PROJ-123: Adding new feature" (gerund form)

## Why These Rules Matter

### Professional Standards
These rules enforce professional Git practices commonly used in enterprise development:
- Consistent formatting makes commit history readable
- Ticket references enable traceability to project management tools
- Imperative mood matches Git's own convention (like "Merge branch...")

### Team Collaboration
- Everyone follows the same conventions
- Code reviews become more focused on content rather than formatting
- Project managers can easily track progress through commit messages

### Automation Friendly
- Standardized formats enable automated tools to parse commit information
- Integration with project management systems becomes seamless
- Release notes can be automatically generated from commit messages

## Quick Setup Guide

To use this action in your repository:

1. Add the action to your `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Customize the regex patterns if needed for your team's conventions
3. Set up any additional security requirements
4. Test with a few commits to ensure the rules work as expected

The default settings provide a good starting point for most teams, focusing on professional commit message formatting with optional ticket tracking integration.
